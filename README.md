# Personalized T2I Task 1
## Subject Transfer

Subject Transfer. A popular method for subject transfer is DreamBooth (https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.12242) which can serve as a starting point. Given a small set of images (e.g., pictures of my dog), the method should allow to put the main subject of the images in a new context. For instance, the prompt "A picture of <my_dog> wearing a suit." should depict the same dog from the sample images but with a novel variation of "wearing a suit". In this example, <my_dog> is a placeholder token similar to how DreamBooth is implemented. You are free to choose any other way to solve the task.
